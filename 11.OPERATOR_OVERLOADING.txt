To perform operator overloading, Python provides some special function or magic function that is automatically invoked when it is associated with that particular operator.

Overload + operator-

# Python Program illustrate how to overload an binary + operator

class A: 
	def __init__(self, a): 
		self.a = a 

	def __add__(self, o): 
		return self.a + o.a
ob1 = A(1) 
ob2 = A(2) 
ob3 = A("Geeks") 
ob4 = A("For") 

print(ob1 + ob2) 
print(ob3 + ob4) 


All operators have one magic method associated with it.


Python program to demonstrate ternary operator
a, b = 10, 20
  
Use tuple for selecting an item
print( (b, a) [a < b] )
