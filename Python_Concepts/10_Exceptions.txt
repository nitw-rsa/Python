Exception handline using try except and raise-

try:
	pass

except IndexError as e:
	print("Some exception")
	raise RuntimeError(e)


In python, you can also use else clause on try-except block which must be present after all the except clauses. The code enters the else block only if the try clause does not raise an exception.


Try startment has a clause called finally which is used for cleanup activities. Finally will always run weather exception is raise or not.
