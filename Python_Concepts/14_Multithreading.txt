Each thread contains its own register set and local variables.

import threading


def cube(a):
    for i in range(100):
        print(f"cube is {a*a*a}")


def square(a):
    for i in range(100):
        print(f"square is {a*a}")


t1 = threading.Thread(target=cube, args=(10,))
t2 = threading.Thread(target=square, args=(10,))

t1.start()
t2.start()

# Wait until thread 1 is completely executed
t1.join()
t2.join()

# Both the threads completed
print("Done")


Demon threads are the threads which runs completely in the background and they exists once main program exits.
Here main thread should no need to wait for child threads to complete.
