Each thread contains its own register set and local variables.


import threading

def print_cube(num):
	print("Cube: {}".format(num * num * num))

def print_square(num):
	print("Square: {}".format(num * num))

if __name__ == "__main__":
	t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_square, args=(10,)) 
	t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cube, args=(10,)) 

	t1.start() 
	t2.start() 

	# wait until thread 1 is completely executed 
	t1.join() 
	# wait until thread 2 is completely executed 
	t2.join() 

	# both threads completely executed 
	print("Done!") 


Demon threads are the threads which runs completely in the background and they exists once main program exits.
Here main thread should no need to wait for child threads to complete.
